# SDK Removed – Study-Only Repository

This project originally depended on a generated Unreal Engine SDK.

⚠️ **Important Notice**

The original SDK files have been **intentionally removed** from this repository.

## Why was the SDK removed?

- The SDK contains thousands of autogenerated headers and source files
- These files are specific to a particular game build and environment
- Redistributing them is unnecessary and potentially problematic
- The goal of this repository is **educational and architectural study only**

## What does this mean?

- ❌ This project will **NOT compile or function** without a valid SDK
- ✅ The repository exists to demonstrate:
  - Project architecture
  - External overlay design
  - Memory reading patterns
  - Shared memory IPC
  - ESP / Aimbot structural logic (non-functional)

## How to use this repository

This codebase is intended for:

- Reverse engineering studies
- Learning project organization
- Understanding external overlay pipelines
- Academic / personal research

If you want to make the project functional, you must:
- Generate your own SDK for your target build
- Place it inside this `SDK/` directory
- Ensure all includes and offsets match your environment
